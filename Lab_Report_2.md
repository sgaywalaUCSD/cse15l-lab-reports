* The methods in the code called are: the main method, parseInt method to get the port from args, Server's start method, StringServer's handleRequest Method, and URI's getPath method.
* relevant arguments to those methods values of relevant fields: The argument for the port is 3221 (randomely chosen), the path is "/add-message", and the query is "?s=Testing Message 1". The value for the URI url is new URI("localhost:3221/add-message?s=Testing Message 1").
* how values of relevant fields change: The value of the message field changes from the empty String to "Testing Message 1\n".

## Part 2

A failure-inducing input for the buggy program:
```
  @Test
  public void testReversed2(){
    int[] input1 = { 5, 7 };
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 7, 5 }, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
```

An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure:
```
  @Test //Testing Empty Array
  public void testReversed1(){
    int[] input1 = { };
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ }, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
```

The symptom, as the output of running the tests:

The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it:
```
//Before (Has Bugs)
  static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = newArray[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return arr;
  }
```

```
//After (Bugs fixed)
  static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      newArray[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return newArray;
  }
```

The bug is that the passed in array and the new array are kind of switched. In the old code, the reversed Array creates a newArray, which contains all 0s, is reversed by changing the contents of the array passed in. However, this fix switches the new Array and the passed in array. This fix makes the new Array contain the reversed contents of the passed in array, and not the other way around.

## Part 3
Something from this lab I learned was, ironically, not so much about bugs and testing. I learned more about how array references work, especially when it comes to references being passed to methods. For example, this code (though it appears like it may work), does not actually reverse the Array in place because of how Array References work:

Instead, a for loop has to be used to change each element of the original array for the code to work, like this:

Ultimately, I learned more about how pass by reference works in java.
